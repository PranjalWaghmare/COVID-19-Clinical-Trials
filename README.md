This project presents a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 clinical trial data, aiming to understand the research efforts, development progress, and strategic direction taken during the pandemic. It explores trends in study phases, intervention types, geographic distribution, and status of ongoing and completed research studies. Using Python and Pandas, the dataset was cleaned and structured to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and optimize the data for analytical processing. Statistical summaries and exploratory visual insights were generated to interpret the scale and impact of the clinical research response to COVID-19.
